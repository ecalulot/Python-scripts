Python programs

Python scripts created while attending a Cybersecurity Bootcamp. These programs were created to help us learn Cryptography and educate us about the early cyphers used. While the cyphers may by elementary it was learning Python which proved more difficult for most of the class. Thankfully I had a head start on learning Java prior and had a heads-up that were going to program in Python. 

You will find these very simple and I hope the documentation of the code can help the reader walk through the code. I welcome you all to comment and help a fellow up-and-coming future programmer.
